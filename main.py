NOTE: Highlights and Notes follow the same structure:
line 1: Title = Atomic Habits: Tiny Changes, Remarkable Results (James Clear)
line 2: MetaData = Your Note/Highlight on Location 174 | Added on Friday, May 7, 2021 5:37:35 AM
    Location and Time (we can use time to try and remove duplicate notes and highlights)
line 3: blank
line 4: Note or Highlight

NOTE: the content preceding a note card is what you highlighted when you wrote the note.
To keep the structure of what you were thinking when you highlighted and took a note, you
want to combine these highlights and notes together

one that contains more highlighted text.

In this case we want to delete the previous note, but we want to associate this
with the same highlight 

We can parse "May 11, 2021 5:44:11 AM" as a date, and then we will keep the most recent date.
To identify similar notes, we will only search the previous note - I rarely go back and update
highlights or notes, I do it immediatley after creating the first highlight/note
